 For our final project, we are going to analyze two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
 
 Vinho Verde is a region in northern Portugal. It is comprised of nine sub-regions bordered by the atlantic ocean, mountain ranges, and a river, which kept the region fairly wet and rainy. Vinho Verde is associated for producing wines that has a *light fizz*. 
 
 We sourced our dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).
 
 
 ## Description of the dataset
 The inputs in the datasets were results from physicochemical tests to characterize the properties of the wine, and the output is based on the ratings from human wine testers.
 
 ### Sample Attributes of Vinho Verde Red wines

 ### Samples Attributes of Vinho Verde White wines

 ## Questions we hope to answer with the data
 
 1. Classify whether the wine is high or low quality
 2. Which physicochemical characteristic contributes to the high or low quality rating of the wine?
